function [D,indS,Z] = distance(X)
%
% distance computes the inverse of the distance of each pixel in the image
% X from all the user marked labels.
%
% [D,inds,Z] = distance(X)
%
% provides the inverse of the distances of the image pixels from each
% marked region. These quantities are used as weights in the Laplacian
% matrix. The matrix Z contains the neighbourhood of each pixel, whilst
% indS contains the indexes of the neighbours.
