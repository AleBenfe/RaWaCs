function [Laplac,D,Z] = laplac_L(X)
% laplac_L computes the Laplacian matrix whose weights are computed using
% the function distance.
%
% [Laplac,D,Z] = laplac_L(X)
%
% provides the Laplacian matrix Laplac, the matrix D which contains the
% distances of each pixel  from the centroids of the marked regions and the
% matrix Z whose elements contains the 9 pixels of each neighbourhood.
